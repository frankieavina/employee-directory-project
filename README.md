### React Component Tree

## Requirements:

- [ ] Your app should have multiple components. Use props to pass data from parent components into child components to allow customization of the child components. (Sometimes it's easiest to start with one or two big components, and to break code out into smaller, more specific components after the core functionality is in place.)
- [ ] Your app should start with an array of data either contained in an in-project `.json` file, or should request data from an external API on initial render. This data should be saved in state.
- [ ] Your app should allow the user to add a new item by completing and submitting an HTML form.
- [ ] Your form should include at least one less traditional form field type: select menu, radio buttons, checkboxes, date input, etc.
- [ ] Use controlled form elements so that as soon as the values stored in the form fields change, the corresponding state value is updated. For this project, you and your partner should handle all form logic by hand and should not use React form libraries like `Formik` or `React Hook Form`.
- [ ] Your form's `submit` button should be disabled until the user has completed all of the required fields.
- [ ] Your app should use a table (or similar structure) to render the data in the app in an understandable fashion.
- [ ] Your app should have a search field that filters the data displayed to match the search term.
- [ ] Your app should allow sorting of the data on at least one field, both ascending and descending.
- [ ] Make your code as DRY (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself) as possible!
